        <p id="p1">Ice Apple</p>
        <p id="p2">Ice apple (palm fruit) is a seasonal fruit of the sugar palm tree and is widely available during the sizzling summer. 
            The fleshy fruit loaded with translucent, juicy fluid has excellent cooling properties.
            Ice apple is very similar to litchi fruit in texture and tastes like a slightly sweet tender coconut.

        <p id="p3">Litchi</p>
        <p id="p2">Known for their sweet and flowery flavor, Litchi is typically eaten fresh and sometimes used in ice creams or processed into juice, wine, sherbert, and jelly. 
            They have an inedible, pink-red, leathery skin, which is removed before consumption. 
            The flesh is white and surrounds a dark seed in the center.</p>

        <p id="p5">Mango</p>
        <p id="p2">“The king of the fruits", mango fruit is one of the most popular, nutritionally rich fruits with unique flavor, fragrance, taste, and heath promoting qualities, making it numero-uno among new functional foods, often labeled as “super fruits".
            Mango is one of the delicious seasonal fruits grown in the tropics. The tree is believed to be originating in the sub-Himalayan plains of the Indian subcontinent.
